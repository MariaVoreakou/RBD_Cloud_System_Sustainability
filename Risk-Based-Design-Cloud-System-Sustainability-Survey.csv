EEST,software engineering,10,"In my experience, the sustainability (environmental, social, and economic) of a system throughout its lifecycle—encompassing design, development, operation, and decommissioning—can be negatively impacted by various risks. These risks can be categorized across different levels: Application Level, System Level, System of Systems Level, and Business Level.
 

 Design and operations have the most significant impact on sustainable applications, particularly at the System of Systems level, where issues such as duplicate applications performing the same functions and bad design are prevalent. At the Application level, resource waste due to inefficient use of resources is also a common issue.
 

 Bad design and improper decision-making lead to unoptimized systems that have negative environmental and social consequences. While economic considerations are often the top priority for businesses, focusing solely on economic gain can result in unsustainable practices. Businesses may still profit, but the environmental and social impacts can be detrimental in the long run.","Consider the situation in our organization regarding how we measure the performance of our advertising. We have developed multiple systems to perform the same tasks due to poor architecture and design. As a result, these systems are independently working towards almost identical outcomes.
 

 The impact of this redundancy is significant. Each system processes between 4TB and 100TB of data daily, consuming substantial resources. Operating on the cloud further deprioritizes sustainability.
 

 As organizations grow and prioritize speed to market, sustainability often receives less focus. This trend highlights the importance of addressing these risks to improve both efficiency and sustainability.","System of Systems Level, Business Level, Application Level, System Level, in this order.

By enforcing laws that mandate sustainable practices, governments ensure that all organizations operate on a level playing field. This is essential in an era where economic considerations often overshadow environmental and social factors, which are sometimes treated as mere publicity stunts. While I hope for a greater focus on sustainability, the current reality underscores the need for regulatory intervention.","I think I have mentioned them already, sustainability is broad topic on its own but great work in progress ahead for all us!"

Similarly the risk of tool choice mostly impacts the Application and System Level where if the incorrect tool is chosen it might be more costly and impact the environment (e.g. servers running and spending electricity when they should be shut down) or economy (cost more). For software maintenance the impact is also on the Application and System Level where it the software is not maintained properly even if it was setup correctly in the beginning it will suffer from the same problems as mentioned before.","Risk of incorrect requirements gathering, because it is the foundation of everything that comes after it.

It is easier to focus on your own bubble, and hard to have an overview looking at how multiple systems interact. Also the higher the level gets, the more people are involved, the more a feeling of shared responsibility grows, which results in less action since an individual feels less responsible and believes others will take care of it.",Enough influence,A bit of influence,A bit of influence,A bit of influence,Strong influence,Enough influence,,

 Business decisions are mainly profit-oriented and by extension are guided by a complex system of stakeholder needs that are disjunct from social or environmental needs. These latter needs may indirectly be captured in the decisions due to regulations or public image considerations but this is a by-product and mainly a nuisance for the business. 
 

 [Application & System Level]
 Technological hindrances to the overall sustainability of systems is due to non-optimized software and on another layer, business and software architectures that focus on decentralized resources, increasing the resource overhead at least linearly with each architectural component. Resource management is crucial to system sustainability.
 

 Especially in enterprise businesses with cloud integrations (where resources are abstract and pricing models obscure), the throughput of perceived innovation along with scalability needs burdens even the economic factor.","Business: Profit-oriented decisions have a blindspot for anything social or environmental by default. E.g. An arms company doesn't need to consider the social or environmental outcome of their business. In this example the business works directly against general sustainability. While this seems as an extreme example, it can act as a measure to judge others. 
 An enterprise retail company with profitability at its focus cannot realistically care about the side-effects (or in some cases immediate effect) of her success to smaller retail `competitors` or to the social and natural environment.
 Another aspect that weights heavily on the social well-being is advertising. 
 Advertising has outgrown itself in the past 20 years, from a business component with specific business goals (read promotion and brand recognizability), it ended up engulfing all business processes, altering the complete direction of businesses. e.g. Amazon's sponsored positions in the listing and surprisingly its opening up to the movie business. These create a product and media social microcosm controlled solely by an oligopoly. 
 If we now com pare Amazon to the arms dealer, we can see similar tactics, 
 * A blind eye for their production's environmental costs.
  While for the latter the production cost is obviously material (emissions et.c.), for Amazon the need to maximize the sales of material goods indirectly has environmental costs. Amazon's cheap labor is another material cost falling mostly under the category of the social. Another topic opens up, Amazon's (and other companies') Environmental Impact reports, masking the real issue by formally minimizing popular metrics (carbon intensity), at the same time improving their image () with charities and environmental work. They can achieve this by outsourcing their impact to outside businesses. As a rule of thumb, whenever a environmental goal is achieved it needs to be either cost-saving (e.g. delivering by EV or bikes) or money-making.
 * Consumption creating a feedback loop, generating more consumption.
 For arms manufacturers consumption would mean arms dealerships, which would mean either war, the potential for war or insurrection. Which results in a hot period for arms dealership and thus manufacturing.
 The same holds true the example of Amazon and other large companies. Here, modern human's addictive tendencies are a feature to the business functioning, and media are tools for social control, trying to augment these tendencies through marketing techniques. 
 

 Application & System Level: Here the main culprit are processing resources. Taking the microservice paradigm, each system should be compartmentalized based on its function, but companies, due to the ongoing demands, are not successful on defining these functions correctly, resulting in leakages on the boundaries and massive duplication of architectural components. This can be seen in larger businesses that are try to decentralize their structure. A good example would be Netflix with its $27 million per month on cloud costs. These translate to processing time and thus to costs, which are at the same time environmental.","The societal and environmental issues are largely dependent on business practices that are purely profit-oriented. Let's not forget that the cloud providers are also profit-oriented, so they will do whatever possible to make their clients spend as much as possible, thus the complex pricing models, the social advertisement of distributed architectures as the go-to solution et.c. The main issue is that if the overall focus of companies would shift away from profit most of them might not be viable, because their profit depends on antisocial practices. For companies to actually change there needs to be a social and political change that seems outlandish for today.",Some influence,A bit of influence,Some influence,A bit of influence,Enough influence,A bit of influence,I take it that influence can mean both negatively and positively. Thus their general importance.,"I didn't know what Risk-based design was before today. I think that working on sustainability issues and making them transparent (via practices, metrics et.c.) can open up the potential for actually caring for these issues. It can also go the opposite way, creating a framework to mask environmental effects (take the example of amazon). At the same time, I think that the environmental solution cannot be managerial, but political, something not in the immediate horizon."

 Application Level: Energy consumption, data privacy, and maintenance costs.
 System Level: Energy efficiency, usability, and integration complexities.
 System of Systems Level: Inter-system dependencies, interoperability, and complexity costs.
 Business Level: Regulatory compliance, brand reputation, and market dynamics.
 Mitigation includes sustainable design, security, inclusivity, and agile adaptation.","1. Application Level
 Environmental: A high-traffic social media app that uses inefficient algorithms, leading to excessive server energy use and higher carbon footprint.
 Social: A banking app that fails to incorporate robust security features, resulting in frequent data breaches and loss of user trust.
 Economic: An e-commerce platform with poorly optimized code, leading to frequent crashes and high costs for bug fixes and maintenance.
 2. System Level
 Environmental: A cloud service provider with outdated data centers consuming excessive energy, contributing to environmental degradation.
 Social: A healthcare management system with a complicated user interface, making it difficult for medical staff to use, potentially compromising patient care.
 Economic: An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system with poor integration capabilities, leading to costly manual workarounds and decreased productivity.
 3. System of Systems Level
 Environmental: A smart city infrastructure with interconnected but inefficient energy systems, resulting in increased overall energy consumption.
 Social: A public transportation network management system that lacks interoperability, causing data silos and poor service coordination.
 Economic: A multinational company's IT systems that fail to scale with growing business demands, resulting in expensive system overhauls.
 4. Business Level
 Environmental: A tech company's neglect of eco-friendly practices, such as recycling e-waste, leading to environmental harm and negative public perception.
 Social: A social media platform's failure to effectively moderate harmful content, leading to widespread misinformation and societal impact.
 Economic: A retail chain's outdated point-of-sale system causing frequent outages during peak shopping seasons, resulting in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.","The most critical risk for overall system sustainability is regulatory compliance and brand reputation at the Business Level. This risk is crucial because non-compliance with environmental, social, and economic regulations can lead to severe legal consequences, financial penalties, and long-term damage to a company's reputation. Additionally, public perception and trust are vital for a company's success; failure in this area can result in loss of customer loyalty, investor confidence, and market share.

What I mean with this is that if there are not incentive to be sustainable (e.g tax reduction or gain in money) it will be difficult that this topic will gain momentum. At the end our world has been built around capitalism so it's all about the money. 
 

 When it comes to political issues, we have to consider that every nation act on it's own despite being part of a system (e.g EU). This is mainly due to the fact that at the end of the day countries are done by individuals and in general individuals are selfish. Therefore this is reflected in a nation behaviours (e.g Turkey might aim for different goals than Spain).",The economical risk. Money is what makes the world move.
